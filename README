workflow of the system (how does it work) 
we invoke the 'iwlist scan' command on the desired machine to get mac address and signal pairs
then we pipe the macaddress-signalstrength pairs over to our form*generator
then we POST that over to skyhook (or any other provider) to get the coordinates of where we are
then we save results as a file in TMP so that other apps can touch it


reference documentation about skyhook API
skyhook endpoint takes in an XML document with a bunch of embedded documents containing access-point mac addresses and signal strengths
<?xml version='1.0'?><LocationRQ xmlns='http://skyhookwireless.com/wps/2005' version='2.6' street-address-lookup='full'><authentication version='2.0'><simple><username>mheld</username><realm>marc@nu</realm></simple></authentication><access-point><mac>000B86982680</mac><signal-strength>-50</signal-strength></access-point><access-point><mac>000B86982681</mac><signal-strength>-50</signal-strength></access-point></LocationRQ>

<signal-strength>STRENGTH (does it make a difference if this is a static value or not? -- we can test this)</signal-strength>

spits back a document like this:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?><LocationRS version="2.6" xmlns="http://skyhookwireless.com/wps/2005"><location nap="3"><latitude>42.33998341634523</latitude><longitude>-71.09059180229337</longitude><hpe>93</hpe><street-address distanceToPoint="26.68249548639868"><street-number>372</street-number><address-line>Huntington Ave</address-line><city>Boston</city><postal-code>02115</postal-code><county>Suffolk</county><state code="MA">Massachusetts</state><country code="US">United States</country></street-address></location></LocationRS>

switching providers in the location program
will refactor to be switchable

is there a quota on the number of times I can request?
asked -- also, is there a way to get location of just one access point?

how to compile for openwrt
requires libcurl (makefile contains dependency)

cronjob to ensure data collection?
To have the location update every 24 hours at 1am as well as after boot, add this to crontab: 
@reboot /path/to/location
0 1 * * * /path/to/location

is there a way to get HTTP requests without libcurl (and all of its dependencies)
not sure -- will do research

extra notes
1) might make sense to just dump the XML file of the location to /tmp/location instead of parsing the xml file -- there's probably going to be some case that brakes the parser (it's really really naive right now -- will fix it very soon)
2) I added an include to regex.h -- however it is a POSIX library, so it *should* be there; I don't have a router to test on at the moment but I will do so as soon as I can
3) you will have so uncomment and change the popen command (lines 149-150) to point to the right iwlist command
4) I will add libcurl to the package to be statically loaded
5) how do you guys deal with version control?
